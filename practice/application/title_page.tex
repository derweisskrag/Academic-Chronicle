\begin{abstract}
This document provides my written interview responses for Canonical's assessment stage. 
It outlines my web and software engineering experience, education background, and personal reflections on Canonical's mission and goals. 
Over the past year, I have deepened my skills across Docker, Rust, Next.js, and deployment pipelines, gaining valuable insights into microservice design, automation, and DevOps workflows.

The following sections summarize my practical experience in full-stack development, backend infrastructure, and teamwork in both academic and professional environments. 
I also discuss my perspectives on open-source collaboration, software performance, and quality practices.
Finally, I reflect on Canonical's purpose within the open-source ecosystem, identifying what inspires me about its mission and how I hope to contribute to its continued growth and innovation.
