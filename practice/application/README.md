# Application at Canonical

## Overview

My application was reviewed by the hiring lead and I was advanced to the next stage of application process, which is called ***Assessment***. During the written interview, I must provide overview of my skills and let the hiring lead understand how strong fit I am for the role that I am pursuing at Canonical.

## Written interview 

Please, read `application.md` or `written_interview.pdf` generated by `pandoc` tool. That is correct! During the completion of the written interview, I showcase my technical skills in `MarkDown` and `LaTeX` followed by `Lua`. It is tiny but important to my future workflows, as it allows me to formally document the work and even automate it using `Bash` or `Lua` scripts.
