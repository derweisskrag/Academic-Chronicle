# Strategy to find the pseudo-internship and fulfill 9 EAP of practice

## Overview

Some companies are said to have undone chunk of work. They cannot afford it to be done
due to `Budget` constraints. As such, they cannot hire the specialist to get the work
done, and that is where our opportunity emerges: we must take the initiative and offer our
volunteer help.


## Strategy idea

Instead of saying 

> I wanna offer my services for free and work for food. Please, give me some work.

we say

> I would like to offer my time and skills to contribue and potentially solve the problems 
or take on tasks you dont have money to hire the right specialist. We focus on `what can I do`, 
instead of `where I can get the job`.
