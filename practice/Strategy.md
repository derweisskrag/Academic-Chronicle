# Strategy to find a pseudo-internship and fulfill 9 EAP of practice

## Overview

A number of companies are known to have a backlog of valuable work that remains undone due to a lack of budget. As such, they cannot afford to hire a full-time specialist to get the work done. This situation presents a unique opportunity for us to take the initiative and offer our services on a volunteer basis.

## The Strategy

Instead of adopting a transactional mindset focused on asking for a job, the strategy involves reframing the conversation to focus on providing value.

The approach is:
"I would like to offer my time and skills to contribute to and potentially solve problems or take on tasks that a company may not have the budget to hire a specialist for."

This approach emphasizes **what I can do** and **the value I can provide**, rather than **where I can get a job**.

## Rationale

This strategy is effective because it targets a specific business problem: **unbudgeted work**. By offering to complete these tasks, we provide a low-risk, high-reward solution for the company. They get a valuable piece of work completed without having to commit to a salary, and we get the practical experience and portfolio project needed for our academic requirements. It transforms a "no" from a formal application process into an opportunity to demonstrate competence and initiative.


## Upgraded Strategy + My lemmas:


### 🧠 Sergei’s Laws of Technical Marketability

A set of guiding principles that describe how developers — especially early in their careers — can increase their visibility, perceived value, and hiring probability in competitive technical markets.

---

## **Lemma 1 — The Experience Bias Lemma**

> In any sufficiently large applicant pool, there exists at least one candidate with nonzero, positive experience (XP).
> Therefore, selection tends to favor those with demonstrable experience over raw potential.

### **Corollary 1.1 — The Visibility Principle**

To counteract zero-XP bias, a candidate must **manufacture perceived experience** through:

* Narrative proof (personal or academic projects)
* Quantifiable impact (metrics, optimization results)
* Public visibility (GitHub, portfolio, open-source presence)

> *“If you lack experience, create visible proof that simulates it.”*

---

## **Lemma 2 — The Stakeholder Communication Lemma**

> If you speak technical dialect, you communicate to engineers.
> If you speak value dialect, you sell to decision-makers.

### **Corollary 2.1 — The Translation Rule**

Every technical action must be translated into **business, time, or emotional value**.

| Technical Dialect                                        | Value Dialect                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “I implemented gzip compression to reduce payload size.” | “I optimized our API delivery — reducing data transfer by 50% and improving user retention.”          |
| “Built a Rust API using Axum.”                           | “Developed a high-performance backend service in Rust — increasing reliability and lowering latency.” |

> *“Translate code into consequences that matter.”*

### **Corollary 2.2 — The HR Filtering Paradox**

Human Resources cannot evaluate technical correctness — only **narrative clarity**.
Therefore, technical accuracy without clarity yields **zero perceived value**.

> *“Sound like business impact wearing a hoodie, not a compiler speaking in bytes.”*

---

## **Meta-Principle — The Bridge Doctrine**

The optimal developer is not the loudest coder, but the clearest translator between logic and value.

> *“Speak code to machines. Speak impact to humans.”*
