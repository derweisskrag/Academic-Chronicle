# Strategy to find a pseudo-internship and fulfill 9 EAP of practice

## Overview

A number of companies are known to have a backlog of valuable work that remains undone due to a lack of budget. As such, they cannot afford to hire a full-time specialist to get the work done. This situation presents a unique opportunity for us to take the initiative and offer our services on a volunteer basis.

## The Strategy

Instead of adopting a transactional mindset focused on asking for a job, the strategy involves reframing the conversation to focus on providing value.

The approach is:
"I would like to offer my time and skills to contribute to and potentially solve problems or take on tasks that a company may not have the budget to hire a specialist for."

This approach emphasizes **what I can do** and **the value I can provide**, rather than **where I can get a job**.

## Rationale

This strategy is effective because it targets a specific business problem: **unbudgeted work**. By offering to complete these tasks, we provide a low-risk, high-reward solution for the company. They get a valuable piece of work completed without having to commit to a salary, and we get the practical experience and portfolio project needed for our academic requirements. It transforms a "no" from a formal application process into an opportunity to demonstrate competence and initiative.
