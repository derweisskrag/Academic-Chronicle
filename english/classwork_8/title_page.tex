\begin{abstract}
This paper examines the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within modern software development workflows. It explores the transition from manual calculations to automated algorithmic systems, highlighting the balance between technical hard skills and human-centric soft skills. Finally, it proposes a structured implementation framework to mitigate operational risks. This report is based on a series of mock examination tasks evaluating technical communication and AI theory.
