\begin{abstract}
This speech explores the impact of video games on mental health, arguing that they are not inherently harmful 
but rather beneficial when used responsibly. It contrasts societal misconceptions with psychological research, 
emphasizing how games stimulate cognitive functions, foster emotional expression, and enhance problem-solving abilities. 
The argument integrates both perspectives of family dynamics and concludes that video games, if played with balance, enrich mental well-being rather than diminish it.
