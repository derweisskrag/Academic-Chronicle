## My speech

Today I want to discuss the common misconception about the video games harmful impact on one's mental health. Many people believe that 
video games are detrimental to person's mental well-being; and that video games must be prohibited. The contention stems from the dissatisfaction in private life where the husband spends most of their time on PS5 video games, whilst their wife is busy with taking care of the children and household duties. From the wife's perspective, the husband's leisure activity is a waste of time; she believes that it is possible to optimize the family life by engaging with more positive and active activities rather than playing a video game. Since the husband refuses to engage in relationship-enhancing activities and focuses on augmented reality, playing video games usually deals substantial damage to the relationship and thus the mental health of the couple. In other words, if a husband spends all his free time playing video games, the wife may feel neglected.

From the man's perspective, however, video games bring joy to his life. They make him feel excited, disappointed, content and frustrated; thereby, making him radiate a positive spectrum of emotions. Should he cease to enjoy games, he feels as if he were a sword put on exhibition, as if that sword were useless; as if no-one needed it. Without leisure activity, his life is nothing but tedious and monotonous  music: it has the ambiance; yet, it lacks the rhythm. Had she loved him, she would enjoy playing games with him. This would have deepened their relationship. However, there begs the question as to whether video games are truly inimical to human well-being.

According to the research, video games are of great essence to the human brain because they stimulate, train and enhance it as long as the actor (a player) is goal-oriented and consistent with their agenda (Wilkinson, Ang, & Goh, 2008). When it comes to provide a unique opportunity for narrative content and immersive remote interaction, games are the perfect choice. It enhances cognitive abilities, promotes problem-solving proficiency and fulfills inquisitiveness.

In conclusion, the assertion that video games harm the one's mental health is oversimplification. In reality, games bring more value to the brain of a person.
If society bans video games, it will deprive people of a valuable tool for learning and stress relief.
