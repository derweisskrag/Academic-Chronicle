\begin{abstract}
This assignment explores the diverse applications of conditional structures in English through two distinct sections: 
a character study of Furina from the game *Genshin Impact*, demonstrating the Zero, First, Second, Third, and Mixed Conditionals; 
and a technical questionnaire on programming languages that illustrates the practical use of these same structures.
