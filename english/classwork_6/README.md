## Classwork 6

### Overview

Classwork - Partner Speaking Task with 2nd and 3rd Conditionals: 1 point for completion.

#### Instructions

Work with a partner. Partner A will ask all the questions in part 1; Partner B will answer each question using a Second Conditional sentence. Then, switch roles. Partner B asks all the questions in part 2, and Partner A answers using a Third Conditional sentence.

#### PART 1: Second Conditional 

The construction: If + Past Simple, ... would/could + base verb. This is about things that are imaginary or unlikely right now. Questions for Partner A to Ask:

1. If you knew five programming languages perfectly, which kind of company would you want to work for?
2. If learning to code were your country's only required school subject, what language would you teach?
3. If a huge social media company offered you a job tomorrow, but you didn't know their coding language, would you accept?
4. If your computer suddenly had the ability to write all the code itself, what would you do with your free time?

#### PART 2: Third Conditional 

The construction: (If + Past Perfect, ... would/could have + Past Participle). This is about how the past could have been different. Questions for Partner B to Ask:

1. If you had started programming when you were ten years old, how would your life have changed by now?
2. If the internet had never been invented 50 years ago, what would have been the biggest challenge for global business?
3. If you had chosen a career in graphic design instead of software development, would you have been happier?
4. If your team had spent more time testing the code last week, what major error would you have avoided?


### Part 1: Second Conditional (imaginary/unlikely present situations)

Questions (Partner A) Answers (Partner B, using Second Conditional) are as follows:

1. If you knew five programming languages perfectly, which kind of company would you want to work for? Response: If I knew five programming languages perfectly, I would want to work for a cutting‑edge AI company.
2. If learning to code were your country's only required school subject, what language would you teach? Response: If coding were the only required subject, I would teach Python because it's beginner‑friendly and powerful.
3. If a huge social media company offered you a job tomorrow, but you didn't know their coding language, would you accept? Response: If a huge social media company offered me a job tomorrow, I would accept and learn their language quickly.
4. If your computer suddenly had the ability to write all the code itself, what would you do with your free time? Response: If my computer could write all the code itself, I would spend my free time exploring new hobbies and traveling.

### Part 2: Third Conditional (imaginary past situations)

Questions (Partner B) Answers (Partner A, using Third Conditional):

1. If you had started programming when you were ten years old, how would your life have changed by now? Response: If I had started programming at ten, I would have become a senior developer much earlier.
2.If the internet had never been invented 50 years ago, what would have been the biggest challenge for global business? Response: If the internet had never been invented, global business would have struggled with communication and logistics.
3.If you had chosen a career in graphic design instead of software development, would you have been happier? Response: If I had chosen graphic design, I might have been happier creatively, but I would have missed coding challenges.
4. If your team had spent more time testing the code last week, what major error would you have avoided? Response: If my team had tested more last week, we would have avoided the database crash in production.


## Story that uses conditionals 

Once prophecy of the Fontaine was resolved through Neuvillitte's power granted by Focalors, the hydro archont; Furina became a mortal person whose destiny is yet to be revealed. One of the most prominent Furina's passion is the consumption of cakes, croissants and coffee. Upon closer inspection of Furina's oral and dental health, it can be noticed that despite her diet, she does not suffer from health issues. It is known that **as long as one brushes** the teeth sufficiently, manages one's diet and drinks enough water, **their gums are**  healthy (Conditional: stating a fact). As such, it can be inferred that Furina maintains excellent oral hygiene and partially resists the temptation of sweets. Did Furina not brush her teeth, she might lose a tooth (Conditional  2nd). It is not surprising at all since her persona is so famous as to have a profound effect on the business  market of all of the Fontaine. 
    
One of the most important people in Furina's life is Neuvillitte, the Iudex of the Fontaine. He provides emotional and financial support to Furina. **If Neuvillette had not provided** emotional and financial support to Furina in the past, **she would not be** so stable and secure in her new life now (Mixed conditionals: 3rd and 2nd). She holds the Iudex in profound esteem, treating his counsel with quiet reverence, lest she should ever disappoint the man who offered her a second home.

During her 500-year-long performance, Furina mastered the art of playing a role; she played the Archon to redeem her people's lives. She believed that in defiance of the prophecy, people would survive and continue to thrive. **But for** her unwavering five-century-long performance, **the people of Fontaine would have been consumed** by the primordial waters and their civilization utterly lost (the 3rd conditional). 

Of Furina's most beloved hobbies, the pursuit of producer-filmmaker serves as a poignant expression of her newly discovered mortal freedom. Not only does she love reading books to get inspiration for her movies, but she is also fond of talking to people. Consequently, **If Furina continues to immerse** herself in literature and dialogue with the citizens of Fontaine, **she will surely create** a series of films that capture the true spirit of the nation (Conditional: the first conditional). 

The saga of the former Hydro Archon is ultimately a simple, elegant study of purpose and freedom. **If a person spends** five hundred years playing a role, **the transition to an authentic life often requires** a new stage (0-conditional). This is the foundational truth of Furina's new era: she exists now not by divine mandate, but by personal choice. Her life, once a necessary performance, is now a passionate pursuit of simple, mortal pleasures. When the curtain finally closes on the grandest stage, all that remains is the unwavering freedom to choose one's own destiny.

## Questionaire

A programming language is a tool that allows developers, engineers to automate some of their tasks using machine technology. The language is an instruction for the machine to execute. The most popular programming language, as of 2025, is JavaScript or JS. It is the integral language of web-development. The second popular choice would be Python for its simplicity and expressiveness. Let us create a basic set of questions that use conditionals:

1. Will your English skills improve if you study Python? - Not necessarily. The main goal of a language is to server the purpose of writing instructions to the machine; to execute a set of insturctions thus automating some of tasks. This may enhance one's communication skills; yet, it will have profound impact on technical thinking.

2. If you could start over, what language would you study? I would study the Python, as it is simplest tool to learn and master; after, I would try Rust.

3. If you master Python, will you be able to switch easily to other languages? If you master Python, you will find that the logic of programming is transferable. However, you will need to learn the new language's syntax and paradigms to be fully effective. The logic is portable, but the language rules are not.

4. What would happen if a developer had not learned any language with static typing? If a developer had not learned a language with static typing (like Java or C#) in the past, they would likely struggle with large-scale projects right now.

5. Provided a machine is powerful enough, does a developer still need to optimize their code? Yes. If a machine is powerful, optimization remains necessary. If code is unoptimized, it still consumes more energy, it still increases cloud computing costs, and it still wastes developer time waiting for builds or tests.
